# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our healthcare engineering community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing healthcare technology for the benefit of patients and healthcare providers worldwide.

## Our Healthcare Mission

This community is dedicated to transforming healthcare software engineering through AI-native GitOps practices. We recognize that our work directly impacts patient care, safety, and healthcare delivery. Therefore, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of:

- **Patient Safety First**: All contributions and discussions prioritize patient safety and healthcare outcomes
- **Regulatory Excellence**: We maintain strict adherence to healthcare compliance requirements (HIPAA, FDA, SOX)
- **Ethical AI**: We develop and deploy AI systems that are transparent, auditable, and aligned with healthcare ethics
- **Collaborative Innovation**: We share knowledge and best practices to advance the entire healthcare technology ecosystem

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our healthcare engineering community include:

### Professional Excellence
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall healthcare community

### Healthcare-Specific Standards
- **Compliance First**: Always considering HIPAA, FDA, and SOX implications in discussions and contributions
- **Patient Privacy**: Never sharing, discussing, or using real Protected Health Information (PHI)
- **Security Mindset**: Approaching all technical discussions with healthcare security and risk management in mind
- **Evidence-Based**: Supporting recommendations with data, research, and established healthcare best practices
- **Audit Readiness**: Maintaining professional communication that would be appropriate for regulatory review

### Technical Excellence
- **Documentation**: Providing clear, healthcare-context documentation for all contributions
- **Testing**: Ensuring robust testing with synthetic data that reflects real healthcare scenarios
- **Accessibility**: Building solutions that work for diverse healthcare environments and user needs
- **Scalability**: Designing solutions that can serve healthcare organizations of all sizes

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

### General Professional Misconduct
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

- **Compliance Undermining**: Promoting practices that violate healthcare regulations or patient safety
- **Regulatory Misinformation**: Spreading false information about healthcare compliance requirements
- **Security Negligence**: Promoting insecure practices for healthcare data or systems
- **Patient Safety Disregard**: Ignoring or minimizing patient safety implications of technical decisions

### AI and Technology Ethics Violations
- **Biased AI Promotion**: Advocating for AI systems that perpetuate healthcare disparities
- **Transparency Violations**: Promoting "black box" AI systems inappropriate for healthcare decision-making
- **Data Misuse**: Advocating for improper use of healthcare data for AI training or analysis
- **Algorithmic Harm**: Promoting AI systems that could cause patient harm or perpetuate bias

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Healthcare-Specific Reporting

If you witness or experience behavior that violates healthcare compliance, patient safety, or regulatory requirements, please report it immediately through our healthcare-specific channels:

### Standard Community Issues
- Email: community@gitops2-healthcare.org
- GitHub: Open a confidential issue with the `conduct` label

### Healthcare Compliance Concerns
- Email: compliance@gitops2-healthcare.org
- Confidential Form: [Healthcare Compliance Reporting Form](link-to-secure-form)

### Patient Safety Concerns
- Email: safety@gitops2-healthcare.org
- Emergency: Follow your organization's patient safety reporting procedures

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident, especially those involving potential healthcare compliance issues.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals, or serious violations of healthcare compliance or patient safety standards.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
